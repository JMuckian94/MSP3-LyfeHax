## Features to be Implemented

### Timer

I want to limit the amount of time the user has to answer questions by implementing a timer set to 10 seconds. This will put pressure on the player but should enhance enjoyment levels by increasing the challenge.

### Right / Wrong Feedback

I want to have the option buttons change color to give the player feedback whether they got the right or wrong answer.

### Different Final Score Responces

I want to implement different messages to appear depending on how well the player did.
