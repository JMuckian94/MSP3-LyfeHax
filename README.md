# Gaming Trivia

## Project Objective

To create a life hacks quick tips website where users can share their tips and tricks with other web users. They will be able to create a basic account which will allow them to post content. Content will just be text for now. Once the user posts their content to the page the post will be assigned the username of the content creator and will also have the date it was posted.

## Website Design Goals

- Design a front end for a data-driven web application that meets accessibility guidelines, follows the principles of UX design, meets its given purpose and provides a set of     user interactions
- Implement custom HTML and CSS code to create a responsive full-stack application consisting of one or more HTML pages with relevant responses to user actions and a set of data   manipulation functions
- Build a non-relational database-backed Flask web application that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain
- Design a database structure that is relevant for your domain, consisting of a minimum of one collection
- Design and implement manual test procedures to assess functionality, usability, responsiveness and data management within the Full Stack web application
- Write Python code that is consistent in style and conforms to the PEP8 style guide (or another explicitly mentioned style guide, such as Google's) and validated HTML and CSS     code
- Include sufficient custom Python logic to to demonstrate your proficiency in the language
- Include functions with compound statements such as if conditions and/or loops in your Python code
- Write code that meets minimum standards for readability (comments, indentation, consistent and meaningful naming conventions)
- Name files consistently and descriptively, without spaces or capitalisation to allow for cross-platform compatibility
- Design a data model that fits the purpose of the project
- Develop the model into a usable non-relational database where data is stored in a consistent
  and well-organised manner
- Create functionality for users to create, locate, display, edit and delete records
- Deploy a final version of the full-stack application code to a cloud-based hosting platform
  (e.g. Heroku) and test to ensure it matches the development version
- Ensure that final deployed code is free of commented out code and has no broken internal
  links
- Document the deployment process in a README file in English that also explains the
  applicationâ€™s purpose and the value that it provides to its users
- Use Git & GitHub for version control of a Full Stack web application up to deployment, using
  commit messages to document the development process.
- Commit final code that is free of any passwords or security sensitive information, to the
  repository and to the hosting platform
- Use environment variables, or files that are in .gitignore, to hide all secret keys
- Ensure that DEBUG mode is turned off in production versions

## UX

### NavBar

For responsiveness on all platforms I used Bootstrap to control the spacing and layout of the page. The navbar has been set to sticky and will follow the user as they scroll down the page. The navbar contains the website brand, which is Lyfehax.ie, as well as the nav elements of Home, About, Join Up, and Contact. These elements can merge into a hamburger on smaller screens and will appear as a dropdown menu once the hamburger element is clicked.

### Home/Index Page

The home page has two images depicting workshops, tool collections, and arts and crafts. These are to signal the purpose of the site to first time users and to add visual decoration. Beneath the hero images, the primary content of the site will be displayed. The 'Hax', what I will be referring to as the user posts, will be displated in a 4x4 grid. Each hax will take up one of two collumns on larger screens. On smaller screens the hax will be displayed using full rows. Each of the hax will have a title, the username of the poster, the date it was posted, and a small preview of the full post. If the post is larger than X number of characters then the rest of the post will be hidden and a link (Read more...) will be displayed.

### About Page

The about page will have similar hero image layout at the top of the page. Beneath these images the 'About Us' section is displayed. This row contains a short paragraph explaining the purpose for the website in relation to the user. This paragraph has a complementing picture alongside it, providing decoration in an otherwise blank space. The sides have been reversed for the next row, with the text explaining what a life hack is and a picture alongside.

### Membership Page

On this page the user will be encouraged to sign up to become a user on the site. This will allow them the ability to create posts of their own where a standard user is only able to read posts. The form has three input sections: Email, Password (IMPLEMENT A REPEAT PASSWORD CHECK), and Username. Once the user has completed the form correctly, and clicked the submit button, the text on the page will change and the data they inputted in the form will be saved to the database. 

### Contact Page

This page will have a contact form to fill out for anyone who wants to contact the site owner. It includes fields for the users email and a text area section for submitting queries. There is a submit button at the bottom of the form. (A MESSAGE RECIEVED NOTIFICATION NEEDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED). This page is decorated similarly to the others with varios images in appropriate places.

### Footer

The footer element is displayed across all pages and contains social media links for the site owner to link to this sites associated social media accounts. The links are to Facebook, Instagram, Youtube and Twitter. Their real world application would be for if Lyfehax.ie became a recognisable brand and needed a social media footprint like most modern companies.

### Admin Page



## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to navigate the page using a screen reader with all page elements labelled appropriately
- As a user, I want all of the content to be of appropriate size on all screens with no overflow
- As a user, I want to be able to view the posts of website members and navigate through them intuatively
- As a user, I want to be able to join as a member and begin posting my own content
- As a user, I want the site to provide visual feedback as I navigate around and interact with visible elements
- As a user, I want the website to store my membership credentials securely in a database
- As a user, I want the website to keep my posts assigned to my user profile with my username visible to other users
- As a user, I as a member, want to be able to edit and delete posts as well as submit posts
- As a user, I as an admin, want to be able to delete any users posts should they breach community guidelines


## User Requirements and Expectations

### Site Owner/Administrator

#### Requirements

The Site Owner/Administrator will require the site to collect and store data from user posts, such as text, date, username, and special key data. The text will be the users 'hax'. The posts include the date in the format: DD/MM/YYYY. The username will be the users identity for posting on the site. A special key will be assigned to the individual users so that they, and their previous contributions and actions on the site, can be tracked and identified quickly in the database. 

#### Expectations

The Site Owner/Administrator will expect the site to load correctly without visual errors. This means having all images, fonts and formats loading without overflowing or clashing with other sections of the page. The posts of users must be clearly distinguishable between each other with margins and borders marking where one post ends and the next begins. I want the username and date of posting to appear in the appropriate location on every post, with username in top left and date in top right, and to be of legible size on all screen widths. 

The site must scale appropriately on all screen widths and utilise the BOOTSTRAP grid effectively. The colours and images must be appropriate for the theme of the website. The colours must be attractive to the user without affecting overall readability of the content.

### Standard User

#### Requirements

They will require the site to allow them to make a membership account and post onto the main page for other users to see. They also need the site to allow them to easily navigate around it. They need to be able to see other users posts with key identifiers such as usernames and dates posted. They need the site to scale appropriately for their large and small devices so that usability or appearance isn't affected when switching between them. 

#### Expectations

They will expect the navigation elements to be similiar to what they have seen on other sites (established norms), so they can easily jump in without having to learn specific UI quirks. They will want the navbar to be sticky so that they can always click on the site logo and other navbar elements to bring them wherever they want to go. For mobile devices and small screens, they will expect the nav elements to merge into a burger icon which produces a menu transition when tapped, so as not to crowd the screen. They will want all the text and posts to be styled and ordered well.

### Visual Design Choices

#### Fonts

For fonts I went with [Urbanist](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Urbanist#standard-styles), which is a low-contrast, geometric sans-serif inspired by Modernist typography and design. It was created using elementary shapesand its neutrality makes it a versatile display font for print and digital mediums. I went for the font weight of 500.

#### Icons

I am using icons from Font [Awesome's](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&p=2&m=free) free gallery. These icons include the recognisable icons used for popular social media platforms.

#### Colors

I used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) to create this neat palette image. Detail on the use of of each color below.

- #222 Eerie Black: This will be the primary base color for the whole site; all other colors will be layered over it
- #ccc Light Grey: This will be used to color all text elements and form fields; text within form fields will inherit the #222 base color
- #
- #
- #

#### Structure

The structure is controlled using [Bootstrap v5.1.1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/). This grid system allowed me to set responsive html5 elements without the need to write media queries for each screen width breakpoint. I have written css styles for the various elements on the site and tweaked the positioning of certain elements within the row/column structure. For smaller screens I hide certain elements, such as hero images, so as not to crowd the page for the user.
