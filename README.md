# Gaming Trivia

## Project Objective

To create a life hacks quick tips website where users can share their tips and tricks with other web users. They will be able to create a basic account which will allow them to post content. Content will just be text for now. Once the user posts their content to the page the post will be assigned the username of the content creator and will also have the date it was posted.

## UX

For responsiveness on all platforms I will be using Bootstrap to control the spacing and layout of the page.

I am going for a simple layout with content appearing in a scrollable list in the center of the page. To the sides will appear auxillary links, categories, or post dates. Still undecided.

The header will contain a website logo, some nav elements which can merge into a hamburger on smaller screens and maybe a headline and search function. Still to be decided.

For users who want to become members and post I will implement a form pop-up which will ask for email, password, and a choice of user name. Once the user has created an account they will then be able to post content. 

I plan on implementing an admin page which will allow someone with admin privilages to edit and delete posts. This allows the admin to moderate the page in adherence to set community guidelines.

### Website Design Goals

- Create a website that is easy to navigate and use.
- Make the website look visually appealing with good choice of fonts, colours, and images.
- Have the users account info and post data stored.
- Allow members and admins to have different levels of privilages.
- Keep all features in separate component pages so bugs can be easily identified.
