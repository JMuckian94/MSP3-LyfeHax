# Gaming Trivia

## Project Objective

To create a life hacks quick tips website where users can share their tips and tricks with other web users. They will be able to create a basic account which will allow them to post content. Content will just be text for now. Once the user posts their content to the page the post will be assigned the username of the content creator and will also have the date it was posted.

## UX

For responsiveness on all platforms I will be using Bootstrap to control the spacing and layout of the page.

I am going for a simple layout with content appearing in a scrollable list in the center of the page. To the sides will appear auxillary links, categories, or post dates. Still undecided.

The header will contain a website logo, some nav elements which can merge into a hamburger on smaller screens and maybe a headline and search function. Still to be decided.

For users who want to become members and post I will implement a form pop-up which will ask for email, password, and a choice of user name. Once the user has created an account they will then be able to post content. 

I plan on implementing an admin page which will allow someone with admin privilages to edit and delete posts. This allows the admin to moderate the page in adherence to set community guidelines.

### Website Design Goals

- Create a website that is easy to navigate and use.
- Make the website look visually appealing with good choice of fonts, colours, and images.
- Have the users account info and post data stored.
- Allow members and admins to have different levels of privilages.
- Keep all features in separate component pages so bugs can be easily identified.

### User Requirements and Expectations

### Site Owner/Administrator

#### Requirements

For the Site Owner/Administrator's purposes I will require the site to collect and store data from user posts, such as text, date, username, and special key data. The text will be the users tips or 'lyfehax' as I will be naming them. The date will only include the date in the format: DD/MM/YYYY. No time will be included. The username will be that which the user chose as an identity for posting on the site. The special key will be assigned to the individual users so that they, and their previous contributions and actions on the site, can be tracked and identified quickly in the database. 

I want user posts to appear in the middle of the page with a margin on each side for medium sized screens upwards. The posts will take up the full screen on small screens and mobile devices. The posts will be scrollable with the newest posts appearing at the top and the oldest appearing at the bottom.

#### Expectations

I expect the site to load correctly without visual errors. This means having all images, fonts and formats loading without overflowing or clashing with other sections of the page. I want the posts of users to be clearly distinguishable between each other with margins and borders marking where one post ends and the next begins. I want the username and date of posting to appear in the appropriate location on every post, with username in top left and date in top right, and to be of legible size on all screen widths. 

I expect the site to scale appropriately on all screen widths and utilise the BOOTSTRAP grid effectively. I want the colours and images to be appropriate for the theme of the website. The colours must be attractive to the user without affecting overall readability of the content.

### Average User

#### Requirements

I require the site to allow me to make a membership account and post onto the main page for other users to see. I also need the site to allow me to easily navigate around it. I need to be able to see other users posts with key identifiers such as usernames and dates posted. I need the site to scale appropriately for my large and small devices so that usability or appearance isn't affected when switching between them. 

#### Expectations

I expect the navigation elements to be similiar to what I have seen on other sites, so I can easily jump in without having to learn specific UI quirks. I want the navbar to be sticky so that I can always click on the site logo to bring me back to the home page. For mobile devices and small screens I want the nav elements to merge into a burger icon which produces a menu transition when tapped. I want all the text and posts to be styled and ordered well.

### Design Choices

For small screens I have gone with a sticky navbar with the site logo and burger icon visible. Clicking on the logo will take the user back to the top and refresh the page. The burger will produce a menu of navigation options with pages such as "about", "contact us", and "...". The posts on mobile and small screens will be minimised to a preview of the content with the title of the post and the first couple of lines visible with a "Read more..." item that will make the post full screen and the rest of the text visible.

Each post will have clear border markings to seperate them from each other. Usernames will be positioned top left and date top right of each post.
